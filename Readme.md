# Teacher Computer Retrieval Application
This application helps in getting route details between academies to aid the teacher computer retrieval by the IT team. 

## Features

* Finds distance along certain routes.
* Gets the number of different routes between two academies along with various stop constraints.
* Gets the number of different routes between two academies with contraint on distance to be covered.
* Gives shortest route between two academies.

## Assumptions
* The distance between two academies is considered an integer.
* The routes defined have one-way traffic, the routes are defined in a single direction â€“ a direct route from "A" to "B" does not imply   the existence of a direct route from "B" to "A". If both of these routes do happen to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily   the same distance.
* If no route exists between two academies, the output given is 'NO SUCH ROUTE'
